# Make a program to build a catalogue of stars in a given image (generated by `create_map.py`)

## Easy:
	* Use fake_stars (1 pixel stars)
	* Don't allow blended stars or bordered stars
	* Use noise = 0

## More difficult:
	* Use real (gaussian) stars
	* Use noise > 0

Your function should take a numpy array and return an astropy table
